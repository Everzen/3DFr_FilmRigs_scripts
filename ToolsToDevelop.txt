1) Align tool - Create the appropriate Constraint and then delete it out
2) Name side switch - Automatically replaces "_l_" with "_r_" or visa versa
3) Flip group creator for mirrored controls
4) Need to adjust IKSetup to work over little single chains
5) Create -x axis flipped controller in an "oreFlip" group
6) A tool that has about 6 search and replace slots where we can put words in like _l_ , _r_ , or front , rear ... etc. Probably needs to save out to an XML file
